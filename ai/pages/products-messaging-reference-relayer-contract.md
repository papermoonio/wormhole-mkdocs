# Relayer Contract

The [Wormhole Relayer Contract on EVM](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/relayer/ethereum/contracts/relayer/wormholeRelayer/WormholeRelayer.sol){target=\_blank} enables cross-chain message delivery with automatic execution on the destination chain. It publishes delivery instructions as Wormhole messages and defines the logic to process them via the `deliver` function. The contract supports optional value forwarding, gas refunds, message overrides, and integration with third-party delivery providers.

## Structure Overview

The Wormhole Relayer system on EVM is implemented as a modular, upgradeable contract suite, organized through layered inheritance and interfaces.

```text
IWormholeRelayer.sol (Interface)
└── WormholeRelayerBase.sol
    ├── WormholeRelayer.sol
    ├── CircleRelayer.sol
    └── TypedUnits.sol
DeliveryProvider.sol (Standalone)
```

**Key Components:**

 - **IWormholeRelayer.sol**: Defines the public interface for the Wormhole Relayer, including delivery functions and fee quoting.
 - **WormholeRelayerBase.sol**: Base logic contract shared by both WormholeRelayer and CircleRelayer. Handles delivery processing, fee management, and VAA parsing.
 - **WormholeRelayer.sol**: Main relayer implementation used with the Wormhole Messaging protocol. Inherits from `WormholeRelayerBase`.
 - **CircleRelayer.sol**: Specialized implementation for Circle messages. Also extends `WormholeRelayerBase`, but is out of scope for this reference.
 - **TypedUnits.sol**: Utility module for safe unit conversions, fee accounting, and delivery quote handling.
 - **DeliveryProvider.sol**: Separate contract that sets and manages delivery pricing and supported chains. Queried by the relayer when calculating fees.

## State Variables

 - **`chainId` ++"uint16"++**: Wormhole chain ID for the current network (e.g., 2 for Ethereum).
 - **`wormhole` ++"IWormhole"++**: Address of the core Wormhole messaging contract used to verify VAAs.
 - **`deliveryProvider` ++"address"++**: Address of the Delivery Provider contract responsible for quoting and setting delivery prices.
 - **`rewardAddress` ++"address"++**: Address that receives excess fees collected from users.
 - **`gasOverheads` ++"mapping(uint16 => GasOverhead)"++**: Per-chain gas overheads used to calculate delivery costs.
 - **`supportedChains` ++"mapping(uint16 => bool)"++**: Tracks which destination chains are supported for message delivery.
 - **`deliveries` ++"mapping(bytes32 => bool)"++**: Records completed deliveries (by VAA hash) to prevent replay.
 - **`deliverySuccessBlock` ++"mapping(bytes32 => uint256)"++**: Stores the block number when a delivery succeeded (used for auditing).
 - **`owner` ++"address"++**: Contract owner with permission to update system parameters (e.g., gas overheads).
 - **`chainHash` ++"uint256"++**: EVM chain ID hash used for cross-checking delivery source chain.
 - **`implementation` ++"address"++**: Address of the current logic contract (used in proxy pattern).
