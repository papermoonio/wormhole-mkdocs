# FAQs

## How do I use deep-linking with Portal?

You can create a direct link to pre-fill chain and asset selections on [Portal Bridge](https://portalbridge.com){target=\_blank} using URL parameters.

| Parameter     | Description                                                |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sourceChain` | A source chain that will be pre-selected.                   |
| `targetChain` | A target chain that will be pre-selected.                   |
| `asset`       | The asset key on the source chain (e.g., SOL, USDC, etc.).  |
| `targetAsset` | The asset key on the destination chain.                     |

Example:

```bash
https://portalbridge.com/?sourceChain=solana&targetChain=ethereum&asset=SOL&targetAsset=WSOL
```

This link will open Portal with:
 
 - **`sourceChain`** pre-selected as `solana`.
 - **`targetChain`** pre-selected as `ethereum`.
 - **`asset`** pre-selected as `SOL`.
 - **`targetAsset`** pre-selected as `WSOL`.

!!! note
    For [**NTT tokens**](/docs/products/token-transfers/native-token-transfers/overview/){target=\_blank}, you can define just one asset if the same token exists across chains.

    Example: [https://portalbridge.com/?sourceChain=ethereum&targetChain=solana&asset=W](https://portalbridge.com/?sourceChain=ethereum&targetChain=solana&asset=W){target=\_blank}

## What does the "Send to a wallet address" field do?

After selecting your tokens and connecting your source wallet on [Portal](https://portalbridge.com/){target=\_blank}, you'll be prompted to connect your destination wallet. At this step, alongside wallet options like MetaMask or Phantom, you'll also see an option labeled "Send to a wallet address".
This flexibility allows you to enter any wallet address as the recipient rather than connecting a destination wallet, enabling you to send tokens to a predefined recipient, such as a team wallet, treasury address, or cold storage wallet.

This field is optional. If left empty, the tokens will be sent to your connected wallet.

## Why is the token that I deployed using the WTT / NTT framework not showing up in the Portal Bridge UI?

While deploying tokens to new chains via Wormhole is fully permissionless, these tokens do not automatically show up on the [Portal](https://portalbridge.com/){target=\_blank} UI. Wormhole Contributors maintain discretion in configuring tokens for Portal to prevent abuse. You can quickly spin up your own UI for token transfers using Wormhole Connect.

- [**NTT Connect Demo**](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/demo-ntt-connect){target=\_blank}
