# Native Token Transfers Executor Integration

The [Executor](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/relayers/executor-framework/){target=\_blank} extends [Native Token Transfers (NTT)](/docs/products/token-transfers/native-token-transfers/overview/){target=\_blank} by enabling permissionless, quote-based relaying and cross-chain execution. Instead of relying on a dedicated relayer, applications can now request a signed quote from an open network of relay providers to automatically complete token redemptions on supported destination chains.

This guide focuses on front-end integration between NTT and Executor. It walks through generating relay instructions, requesting a signed execution quote, invoking your sending contracts, and tracking relay status on-chain, with dedicated implementation details for both EVM and SVM chains.

The Wormhole [NTT TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/tree/main/sdk){target=\_blank} now includes a built-in route for NTT with Executor, with implementations for both [EVM](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/blob/2aaa82baeb2c0fa513f41f0561cd5613d265ddea/evm/ts/src/nttWithExecutor.ts#L63){target=\_blank} and [Solana (SVM)](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/blob/main/solana/ts/sdk/nttWithExecutor.ts){target=\_blank}, making it straightforward to integrate into existing workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [NTT deployed](/docs/products/token-transfers/native-token-transfers/get-started/){target=\_blank} on both the source and destination chains.
- Verified that both source and destination chains are supported and that NTT with Executor (`ERN1`) is enabled on the destination chain. 

??? info "How to verify chain and relay type support"

    You can confirm chain and relay type support using the capabilities endpoint:

    ```sh
    GET https://executor-testnet.labsapis.com/v0/capabilities
    ```
    The response includes:

      - Supported source and destination chains
      - Available relay types (e.g., `wormhole` or `ERN1`).
      - Gas drop-off limits, which define the maximum gas the relay provider can allocate.

    Chain identifiers returned by this endpoint use Wormhole chain IDs. A complete list of supported Wormhole chain IDs is available in the [Chain IDs reference](/docs/products/reference/chain-ids/){target=_blank}.

    The relay provider will only respect the first `GasDropOffInstruction` and will drop off the lesser of the requested amount and the configured limit.

## Generate Relay Instructions

Relay instructions define how the Executor should perform the relay on the destination chain, including parameters such as gas limits, message value, and additional execution options. They are serialized into a compact byte format and passed to the Executor contract when a transfer is submitted. Before generating relay instructions, install the SDK [Definitions](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/blob/main/sdk/definitions/src/nttWithExecutor.ts){target=\_blank} package:

```sh
npm i @wormhole-foundation/sdk-definitions
```

[Layouts](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/b9035ad835d70bb19df366662682d3510461d72b/core/definitions/src/protocols/executor/relayInstruction.ts){target=\_blank} for the Executor `RelayInstructions` are provided by the Wormhole TypeScript SDK. Once installed, use the `serializeLayout` helper to construct and encode your relay instructions:

```ts
import {
  encoding,
  serializeLayout,
  UniversalAddress,
} from "@wormhole-foundation/sdk-connect";
import { relayInstructionsLayout } from "@wormhole-foundation/sdk-definitions";

const relayInstructions = serializeLayout(relayInstructionsLayout, {
  requests: [
    {
      request: {
        type: "GasInstruction",
        gasLimit: 500000n,
        msgValue: 0n,
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `type` ++"GasInstruction"++

    Defines the instruction to allocate gas for the relay.

    ---

    `gasLimit` ++"uint"++

    Specifies the maximum gas available for executing the redeem transaction on the destination chain.

    ---

    `msgValue` ++"uint"++

    Represents the amount of native token (e.g., ETH, SOL) to forward with the transaction. This parameter is typically set to 0 for NTT transfers.

Relay instructions are encoded using the `relayInstructionsLayout`, which always expects an array of instruction objects. Each array element is a `RelayInstruction` whose `request.type` determines the specific variant:

| Instruction             | Description                                                               | Fields                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `GasInstruction`        | Defines gas allocation for relay execution                                | `gasLimit`, `msgValue` |
| `GasDropOffInstruction` | Drops native tokens to a wallet on the destination chain                  | `dropOff`, `recipient` |

Relay instructions can include multiple requests (e.g., for gas, value transfer, or drop-off). For most CCTP with Executor flows, a single `GasInstruction` is sufficient.

### EVM

For EVM-based destination chains:

- `gasLimit` defines the redeeming transaction gas limit on the destination chain. Actual gas usage depends on the token configuration, manager setup, and chain parameters.
- `msgValue` is not used by NTT Transceivers’ `receiveMessage` function and should be set to 0.

### SVM

For Solana and other SVM chains:

- `gasLimit` represents the total compute units required across all transactions, plus a 20% buffer.
- The relayer estimates required compute units using logic similar to [`determineComputeBudget`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-sdk-ts/blob/2cf3749f01c09e97693fc8872180db442c09c778/platforms/solana/src/signer.ts#L357){target=\_blank}, which simulates the transaction and sets the budget to 120% of the simulated `unitsConsumed`. This logic allows the relayer to automatically determine the budget required for each transaction in the series needed to perform an NTT redeem.
- `msgValue` must cover the lamports required for the transaction, including priority fees and rent. Transfers to Solana are redeemed to an [associated token account (ATA)](https://www.solana-program.com/docs/associated-token-account){target=\_blank}, which must exist before redemption. If missing, the relayer will automatically create the ATA, increasing rent cost and required `msgValue`.
- When using a non-zero `GasDropOffInstruction` for a new wallet, the drop-off amount must be greater than the `getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption` lamports. Wormhole's relayer will ignore drop-offs to new accounts if they are below the minimum, as the transaction would fail.

## Request a Signed Quote

Once your relay instructions are generated, request a `SignedQuote` from the Executor Relay Provider. A signed quote authorizes the relay provider to execute the transfer and includes the estimated cost of execution. The following is an example of a quote request from Sepolia to Base Sepolia. See the complete list of supported [chain IDs](/docs/products/reference/chain-ids/){target=\_blank}.

```ts
const EXECUTOR_URL = 'https://executor-testnet.labsapis.com';
const { signedQuote: quote, estimatedCost: estimate } = (
  await axios.post(`${EXECUTOR_URL}/v0/quote`, {
    srcChain: 10002,
    dstChain: 10004,
    relayInstructions,
  })
).data;
```

??? interface "Parameters"

    `srcChain` ++"uint16"++

    Specify the Wormhole chain IDs for the source networks.

    ---

    `dstChain` ++"uint16"++

    Specify the Wormhole chain IDs for the destination networks.

    ---

    `relayInstructions` ++"Uint8Array"++

    Encodes the execution parameters you generated in the previous step.

Example response:

```sh
{
  "signedQuote": "0x455130315241c9276698439fef2780dbab76fec90b633fbd000000000000000000000000f7122c001b3e07d7fafd8be3670545135859954a271227140000000067dd750f00000000000003e80000000000514b7c000011bbaf716200000011bbaf716200f86edc3960908d257472836d5b1c33c457bf17af67a758d9984356e7166bec8162faa0e07f991d061b93e4f033895c71134a30d9ca369c606fcabba0b742d2431c",
  "estimatedCost": "1431935000000"
}
```

??? interface "Returns"

    `signedQuote` ++"string"++

    A signed authorization used in the on-chain call to the Executor. Includes quote data and a 65-byte ECDSA signature.

    ---

    `estimatedCost` ++"string"++

    The total estimated gas or lamport cost for the relay.

Signed quotes have an expiry time and must be generated for each request. The Executor contract will revert if the quote expires before on-chain submission.

## Call Sending Contract

Once you have generated your relay instructions and received a signed quote, use them to call your sending-side contract. Refer to the [NTT With Executor Addresses](/docs/products/reference/executor-addresses/#ntt-with-executor){target=\_blank} page for the complete list of deployed helper contracts.

### EVM

For EVM-based transfers, an `NttManagerWithExecutor` contract combines the standard NTT `transfer` and the Executor’s `requestExecution` into a single call. The `INttManagerWithExecutor` interface is defined as follows:

```ts
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache 2
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

struct ExecutorArgs {
    // The msg value to be passed into the Executor.
    uint256 value;
    // The refund address used by the Executor.
    address refundAddress;
    // The signed quote to be passed into the Executor.
    bytes signedQuote;
    // The relay instructions to be passed into the Executor.
    bytes instructions;
}

struct FeeArgs {
    // The fee in tenths of basis points.
    uint16 dbps;
    // To whom the fee should be paid (the "referrer").
    address payee;
}

interface INttManagerWithExecutor {
    /// @notice Error when the refund to the sender fails.
    error RefundFailed(uint256 refundAmount);

    /// @notice Transfer tokens using the Executor for relaying.
    /// @param nttManager The NTT manager used for the transfer.
    /// @param amount The amount to transfer.
    /// @param recipientChain The Wormhole chain ID for the destination.
    /// @param recipientAddress The recipient address.
    /// @param refundAddress The address to which unused gas is refunded.
    /// @param shouldQueue Whether the transfer should be queued if the outbound limit is hit.
    /// @param encodedInstructions Additional instructions for the destination chain.
    /// @param executorArgs The arguments to be passed into the Executor.
    /// @param feeArgs The arguments used to compute and pay the referrer fee.
    /// @return msgId The resulting message ID of the transfer.
    function transfer(
        address nttManager,
        uint256 amount,
        uint16 recipientChain,
        bytes32 recipientAddress,
        bytes32 refundAddress,
        bool shouldQueue,
        bytes memory encodedInstructions,
        ExecutorArgs calldata executorArgs,
        FeeArgs calldata feeArgs
    ) external payable returns (uint64 msgId);
}
```

If the NTT Manager is configured with a Transceiver that supports the Legacy Standard Relayer, the automated relaying must be disabled when using the Executor. The `encodedInstructions` parameter contains serialized NTT instructions that control transceiver behavior. When Standard Relayer instructions are included, set the `automatic` flag to `false` so that delivery is handled exclusively by the Executor. This ensures the transfer follows the intended Executor integration path.

### SVM

For Solana and other SVM-based chains, two helper programs are available to assist with generating and submitting NTT execution requests:

- [example-ntt-svm-lut](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-ntt-svm-lut){target=\_blank}: Manages Lookup Tables for NTT programs without canonical LUTs.
- [example-ntt-with-executor-svm](https://github.com/wormholelabs-xyz/example-ntt-with-executor-svm){target=\_blank}: Generates and attaches Executor relay instructions on-chain to reduce transaction size.

Together, these helpers allow you to compose and send a full NTT with Executor transaction using the Wormhole TypeScript SDK. Below is a simplified example adapted from the SDK implementation:

```ts
const ntt = await s.getProtocol("Ntt", {
  ntt: {
    chain: "Solana",
    manager: ...,
    token: ...,
    transceiver: { wormhole: ... },
  },
});
...
// as of this writing, there's only one tx on Solana
const txs = ntt.transfer(
  new SolanaAddress(payer.publicKey),
  1n,
  {
    chain: "Sepolia",
    address: new UniversalAddress(
      recipientWallet,
      "hex"
    ),
  },
  { queue: false, automatic: false }
);
for await (const tx of txs) {
	// https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/native-token-transfers/blob/b4aa0e34755f735fca40e4566e07c17ac6b2b812/solana/ts/sdk/ntt.ts#L970C8-L970C20
	if (tx.description === "Ntt.Transfer") {
		// Not sure if the first signer will always be the outbox
	  const outboxKeypair = tx.transaction.signers[0];
	  // Get the lookup tables configured on the NTT manager
	  const luts: AddressLookupTableAccount[] = [];
	  try {
	    // @ts-ignore
	    luts.push(await ntt.getAddressLookupTable());
	  } catch (e) {
	    console.log(e.message);
	  }
	  // Decompile the message
	  const message = TransactionMessage.decompile(
	    tx.transaction.transaction.message,
	    { addressLookupTableAccounts: luts }
	  );
	  // Add the execution request to the message
	  const exampleNttWithExecutorProgram = new Program<ExampleNttWithExecutor>(
      ExampleNttWithExecutorIdl as ExampleNttWithExecutor,
      provider
    );
    message.instructions.push(
      await exampleNttWithExecutorProgram.methods
        .relayNttMesage({
          execAmount: new BN(estimate.toString()),
          recipientChain: chainToChainId("Sepolia"),
          signedQuoteBytes,
          relayInstructions: Buffer.from(relayInstructions.substring(2), "hex"),
        })
        .accounts({
          payee: new web3.PublicKey(signedQuoteBytes.subarray(24, 56)),
          nttProgramId,
          nttPeer: web3.PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
            [
              Buffer.from("peer"),
              encoding.bignum.toBytes(chainToChainId("Sepolia")),
            ],
            nttProgramId
          )[0],
          nttMessage: outboxKeypair.publicKey,
        })
        .instruction()
    );
    // If the canonical NTT manager lookup table did not exist
    if (luts.length === 0) {
      // This should probably check the program version and only do this for versions without the canonical lookup table
      // Otherwise, it should call `initializeLut` on the manager(?)
      // I'm not sure if that is already checked somewhere in the SDK
      console.log("no manager lookup table found, checking helper program");
      const exampleNttSvmLutProgram = new Program<ExampleNttSvmLut>(
        ExampleNttSvmLutIdl as ExampleNttSvmLut,
        provider
      );
      const lutPointerAddress = web3.PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
        [Buffer.from("lut"), nttProgramId.toBuffer()],
        exampleNttSvmLutProgram.programId
      )[0];
      let lutPointer = await exampleNttSvmLutProgram.account.lut.fetchNullable(
        lutPointerAddress
      );
      if (!lutPointer) {
        console.log("no helper program lookup table found, initializing...");
        const recentSlot =
          (await exampleNttSvmLutProgram.provider.connection.getSlot()) - 1;
        const tx = await exampleNttSvmLutProgram.methods
          .initializeLut(new BN(recentSlot))
          .accounts({
            nttProgramId,
          })
          .rpc();
        console.log(`initialized lookup table: ${tx}`);
        while (!lutPointer) {
          // wait for lut to warm up
          await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
          lutPointer = await exampleNttSvmLutProgram.account.lut.fetchNullable(
            lutPointerAddress
          );
        }
      }
      const response = await connection.getAddressLookupTable(
        lutPointer.address
      );
      if (!response.value) {
        throw new Error("unable to fetch lookup table");
      }
      luts.push(response.value);
    }
    // Recompile the message with the lookup table (whether manager or helper)
    tx.transaction.transaction.message = message.compileToV0Message(luts);
    // Broadcast
    const hash = await provider.sendAndConfirm(
      tx.transaction.transaction,
      tx.transaction.signers,
      { commitment: "confirmed" }
    );
  }
}
```

## Check the Transaction Status

After submitting your transaction, you can query the relay provider to check its execution status and confirm whether the transfer has been processed and finalized by the Executor.

```ts
const res = await axios.post(`${EXECUTOR_URL}/v0/status/tx`, {
  txHash,
  chainId,
});
```

You can also link directly to the transaction in the Explorer:

```ts
`https://wormholelabs-xyz.github.io/executor-explorer/#/chain/${chainId}tx/${txHash}?endpoint=${encodeURIComponent(
  EXECUTOR_URL
)}`;
```

## Conclusion

Integrating Executor with NTT enables permissionless, quote-based execution of cross-chain transfers. By combining NTT’s native transfer mechanism with Executor’s open relay network, applications can achieve automated, end-to-end redemption across EVM and Solana chains without relying on centralized relayers.
