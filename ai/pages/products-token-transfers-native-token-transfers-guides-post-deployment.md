# NTT Post-Deployment Steps

To offer the best user experience and ensure the most robust deployment, Wormhole contributors recommend the following after you have deployed Native Token Transfers (NTT):

- Implement a robust testing plan for your multichain token before launching.
- Ensure comprehensive, documented security measures are followed for custody of contract ownership, control of keys, and access control roles. Check the [NTT configuration](/docs/products/token-transfers/native-token-transfers/configuration/access-control/){target=\_blank} for more details on ownership and rate limits.
- Use the [NTT CLI](/docs/products/token-transfers/native-token-transfers/reference/cli-commands/#general-commands){target=\_blank} to perform cross-chain token transfers against your deployed configuration for validation and operational testing.
- Consider a streamlined, customizable frontend such as [Connect](/docs/products/connect/overview/){target=\_blank} for an optimized user experience.
- Alternatively, the [Wormhole TypeScript SDK](/docs/tools/typescript-sdk/get-started/){target=\_blank} allows for a direct integration into your infrastructure.
- Ensure ecosystem actors such as block explorers, automated security tools (such as BlockAid and Blowfish), and wallets (such as MetaMask, Backpack, and Phantom) are aware of your multichain deployment and that it is labeled appropriately.
- Monitor and maintain your multichain deployment.

## Post-Deployment Settings

The following table outlines post-deployment settings available on the NTT Manager contract. These allow you to update roles, pause activity, and adjust transfer limits—useful for upgrades, incident response, or protocol tuning after initial deployment.

| Setting                 | Effect                                   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `pause`                 | Pauses the manager.                      |
| `unpause`               | Unpauses the manager.                    |
| `setOwner`              | Changes the manager owner.               |
| `setPauser`             | Changes the pauser role.                 |
| `setOutboundLimit`      | Sets outbound transfer limit.            |
| `setInboundLimit`       | Sets inbound transfer limit (per chain). |
| `setTransceiverPauser ` | Changes pauser for a transceiver.        |
