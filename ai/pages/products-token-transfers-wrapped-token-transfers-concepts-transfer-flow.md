# Flow of a WTT Transfer

The Wormhole [Wrapped Token Transfers (WTT)](/docs/products/token-transfers/wrapped-token-transfers/overview/){target=\_blank} enables token transfers across blockchains by combining token-specific logic with [Wormhole's core messaging layer](/docs/protocol/architecture/){target=\_blank}. Each supported chain runs its own WTT contract, which manages actions such as locking, burning, minting, and releasing tokens. These contracts communicate directly with Wormhole's core message-passing layer to securely transmit messages between chains.

This guide provides a conceptual overview of WTT and its integration with the messaging layer. It outlines each step of the transfer flow and explains how different transfer types work in practice.

!!! note "Terminology" 
    The SDK and smart contracts use the name Token Bridge. In documentation, this product is referred to as Wrapped Token Transfers (WTT). Both terms describe the same protocol.

## Transfer Flow

Cross-chain token transfers using WTT follow these steps:

1. **Initiation on the Source Chain**

    The transfer begins when a user calls the WTT contract on the source chain:

    - **Wrapped tokens**: The token is burned.
    - **Original tokens**: If the token is native to the source chain, the token is locked in the contract.

2. **Transfer Message Publication**

    The WTT contract invokes the Wormhole [Core Contract](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/core-contracts/){target=\_blank}, which emits an on-chain message event describing the transfer.

3. **Message Observation and Signing**

    [Guardians](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/guardians/){target=\_blank}—a decentralized network of validators—monitor the source chain for these message events. A supermajority (13 out of 19) signs the event to generate a [Verified Action Approval (VAA)](/docs/protocol/infrastructure/vaas/){target=\_blank}—a cryptographically signed attestation of the transfer.

    The VAA is then published to the Wormhole network.

4. **VAA Submission to the Destination Chain**

    The VAA must be submitted to the WTT contract on the destination chain to complete the transfer. The WTT contract then verifies the VAA by calling the Core Contract behind the scenes. This step can be handled in two ways:

    - **Automatic**: A relayer service detects the VAA and submits it to the WTT contract.
    - **Manual**: The user or dApp retrieves the VAA and submits it directly to the WTT contract.

5. **Finalization of the Transfer on the Destination Chain**

    After the VAA is verified on the destination chain, the WTT contract completes the transfer:

    - **Wrapped tokens**: A wrapped representation of the original token is minted.
    - **Original tokens**: If the token is native to the destination chain, the token is released to the recipient.

Consider this example: Alice wants to send 5 ETH from Ethereum to Solana. The ETH is locked on Ethereum’s WTT, and an equivalent amount of wrapped ETH is minted on Solana. The diagram below illustrates this transfer flow.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice as Alice
    participant WTTEth as WTT Ethereum<br>(Source Chain)
    participant CoreEth as Core Contract Ethereum<br>(Source Chain)
    participant Guardians
    participant WTTSol as WTT Solana<br>(Destination Chain)
    participant CoreSol as Core Contract Solana<br>(Destination Chain)

    Alice->>WTTEth: Initiate ETH transfer<br>(lock ETH)
    WTTEth->>CoreEth: Publish transfer message
    CoreEth-->>Guardians: Emit message event
    Guardians->>Guardians: Sign and publish VAA

    alt Automatic VAA submission
        Guardians->>WTTSol: Relayer submits VAA
    else Manual VAA submission
        Alice->>Guardians: Retrieve VAA
        Alice->>WTTSol: Submit VAA
    end

    WTTSol->>CoreSol: Verify VAA
    CoreSol-->>WTTSol: VAA verified
    WTTSol-->>Alice: Mint wrapped ETH on Solana (complete transfer)
```

Maybe Alice wants to transfer her wrapped ETH on Solana back to native ETH on Ethereum. The wrapped ETH is burned on Solana’s WTT, and the equivalent 5 ETH are released on Ethereum. The diagram below illustrates this transfer flow.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Alice
    participant WTTSrc as WTT Solana<br>(Source Chain)
    participant CoreSrc as Core Contract Solana<br>(Source Chain)
    participant Guardians
    participant WTTDst as WTT Ethereum<br>(Destination Chain)
    participant CoreDst as Core Contract Ethereum<br>(Destination Chain)

    User->>WTTSrc: Initiate transfer <br> (burn wrapped ETH)
    WTTSrc->>CoreSrc: Publish message
    CoreSrc-->>Guardians: Emit message event
    Guardians->>Guardians: Sign and publish VAA

    alt Automatic VAA submission
        Guardians->>WTTDst: Relayer submits VAA
    else Manual VAA submission
        User->>Guardians: Retrieve VAA
        User->>WTTDst: User submits VAA directly
    end

    WTTDst->>CoreDst: Verify VAA
    CoreDst-->>WTTDst: VAA verified
    WTTDst-->>User: Release native ETH on Ethereum (Complete transfer)
```

## Automatic vs. Manual Transfers

WTT supports two modes of transfer, depending on whether the VAA submission step is handled automatically or manually:

- **Automatic**: A relayer service listens for new VAAs and automatically submits them to the destination chain.
- **Manual**: The user (or dApp) must retrieve the VAA and manually submit it to the destination chain.

Here's a quick breakdown of the key differences:

| Feature                   | Automatic Transfer          | Manual Transfer                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Who submits the VAA?      | Relayer                     | User or dApp                        |
| User Experience           | Seamless, one-step          | Requires manual intervention        |
| Best for                  | End-users, simple UIs       | Custom dApps, advanced control      |
| Dependency                | Requires relayer support    | None                                |

### Completing Manual Transfers

The user who initiated the transfer must complete it within 24 hours for manual transfers. Guardian Sets are guaranteed to be valid for at least that long. If a user waits longer, the Guardian Set may have changed between initiation and redemption, causing the VAA to be rejected.

If this occurs, follow the [Replace Outdated Signatures in VAAs](){target=\_blank} tutorial to update the VAA with signatures from the current Guardian Set.

## WTT Relayer (TBR)

When completing an automatic transfer using WTT, either through [Connect](/docs/products/connect/overview/){target=\_blank} or programmatically via the [Wormhole TypeScript SDK](/docs/tools/typescript-sdk/get-started/){target=\_blank}, the WTT Relayer (TBR) manages the interaction with the underlying WTT contracts on [supported chains where the TBR is available](/docs/products/connect/reference/support-matrix/){target=\_blank}.



### Flow of an Automatic Transfer via TBR

The flow of an automatic transfer using the TBR looks like this:

1. **Initiation on the Source Chain**

    The transfer begins when a user initiates a transfer on the source chain, which results in the TBR contract being called.

2. **Prepare and Forward the Transfer**

    The TBR verifies the token, encodes transfer details (relayer fee, native gas request, recipient), and forwards the transfer to WTT.

3. **Core Messaging Layer Processes the Transfer**  

    WTT emits a message to the Core Contract. Guardians observe the message and produce a signed VAA attesting to the transfer. 

4. **Off-Chain Relayer Observes the VAA**

    An off-chain relayer verifies the destination chain and token registration and then prepares to complete the transfer.

5. **Relayer Computes Native Drop-Off and Submits the VAA**

    The relayer queries the destination TBR for the native gas amount, includes it in the transaction, and submits the signed VAA.

6. **TBR Validates and Completes the Transfer**
    
    The destination TBR validates the VAA by invoking the WTT contract, confirms it's from a registered TBR, verifies the token and native gas request, and then takes custody of the tokens.

7. **Asset Distribution on the Destination Chain**

    The TBR sends the remaining tokens and native gas to the user, pays the off-chain relayer fee, and refunds any excess native tokens.

The following diagram illustrates the key steps in the source chain during a transfer:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant SourceTBR as Source Chain TBR
    participant SourceWTT as Source Chain WTT
    participant Messaging as Core Messaging Layer

    User->>SourceTBR: Initiate transfer (token, <br>recipient, fees, native gas)
    SourceTBR->>SourceWTT: Forward transfer (burn or lock tokens)
    SourceWTT->>Messaging: Publish transfer message
```

Once the core messaging layer processes the transfer, the destination chain handles completion as shown below:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Messaging as Core Messaging Layer
    participant Relayer as Off-chain Relayer
    participant DestTBR as Destination Chain TBR
    participant DestWTT as Destination Chain <br> WTT
    participant DestUser as User <br> (Destination Chain)

    Messaging->>Relayer: Emit signed VAA for transfer
    Relayer->>Relayer: Verifies destination chain and token registration
    Relayer->>DestTBR: Query native gas amount
    Relayer->>DestTBR: Submit signed VAA
    DestTBR->>DestWTT: Validate VAA
    DestTBR->>DestTBR: Take custody of tokens
    DestTBR->>DestUser: Send tokens (after fees & native gas)
    DestTBR->>Relayer: Pay relayer fee & refund excess
```
